  <h3>SQL</h3>

  <p>
    There are many ways to use SQL. For this workshop we're going to use
    the Firefox SQLite plugin.
    
  <p>
    The installation is the same for all operating systems.


    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="windows">Installation</h4>
      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li>If you don't have Firefox already, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"><b>Download the Firefox Installer</b></a>
	  <li>Follow the instructions to install Firefox
	  <li>Install the SQLite Manager add on: 
	    <br> Go to <b>Menu (the three horizontal lines near the
top right corner of Firefox) OR Tools -> Add-ons -> Search -> SQLite
Manager -> Install -> Restart now </b>
	  <li>Add SQLite Manager to the menu: <b>Menu OR (View -> Toolbars) -> Customize, then drag the SQLite
   Manager icon to one of the empty menu squares on the right, Exit Customize</b>
	    <li>Open SQLite Manager: <b>Menu OR Tools -> SQLite Manager</b>
	     <li>To force SQLite to open in a Firefox tab instead of its own window (this allows you to use Firefox options like zoom), in the SQLite window: Tools -> Options -> Under <i>Start SQLite Manager</i> select <i>in a new tab</i>
	    </ul>
